Partnerships: We engage selected business and channel partners, resellers, distributors and providers of professional services related to our Services, which allow us to explore and pursue growth opportunities by facilitating a stronger local presence and tailored experiences for our Customers, Users and Prospects. In such instances, we may share relevant contact, business and usage details with the respective partner, to allow them to engage with those entities and individuals for such purposes. If you directly engage with any of our partners, please note that any aspect of that engagement which is not directly related to the Services and directed by Gong is beyond the scope of Gong’s Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy, and may therefore be covered by the partner’s terms and privacy policy.

Service Integrations: You may choose to use a third-party service to integrate with our Services, for example in order to upload or retrieve personal data to or from the Services, or to enrich the data you have processed on either service or enhance your usage thereof (provided that such integration is supported by our Services). The provider of this integrated third-party service may receive certain relevant data about or from your account on the Services, or share certain relevant data from your account on the third-party provider’s service with our Services, depending on the nature and purpose of such integration.
